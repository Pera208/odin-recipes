    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <li>Â¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
      <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded mild Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Cook beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crumbly and
        brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir spaghetti sauce into beef. Reduce heat and
        simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in
        spaghetti; cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add spaghetti to meat mixture; mix well. Transfer to a 9x13-inch dish.
        Top with Cheddar cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese is bubbly,
        about 30 minutes.
